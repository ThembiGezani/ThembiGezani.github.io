                    I'm a frontend web developer aged 21 based in Lusaka Zambia. I am passionate about coding and web development. I began my web development journey in January 2022 when i enrolled in an I.T course at Evelyn Hone College of Applied arts and Commerce based in Lusaka Zambia. Since then, i have worked on a number of projects as part of my course work and i am set to graduate in november of this year. I'm a Quick learner and very open to learning new things all the time.I like to work in groups or teams as work is made easier that way and also provides opportunities to learn different views of how to solve problems.
